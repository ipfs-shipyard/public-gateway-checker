**NOTE:** With the exception of `ipfs.io` and `dweb.link`, all gateways listed are hosted by third parties and should be treated as such.

## Adding a new public gateway

If you'd like to add a new public gateway, please edit `gateways.json`:
1. Add the gateway's address to the bottom of the list
2. Make sure the final item in the list does **not** have a comma at the end, but all preceding items do

Then, submit a pull request for this change. Be sure to follow all the directions in the pull request template so your PR can be triaged as quickly as possible.

## Testing locally

```

## Command line
